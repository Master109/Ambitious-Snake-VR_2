# Ambitious Snake VR  
To find the code look in Assets->Standard Assets->Scripts  
The game is meant to be played on Oculus devices, and although it works with keyboard and mouse, it is a terrible way of controlling the game  
In the top menu bar of the Unity editor, select the "Game" dropdown and then select one of the options to change the input devices  
## Controls

Press the A, B, X, or Y button or either trigger to access the menu  
### Keyboard and Mouse  
Hold the w key to move towards where the camera is looking  
Hold the left mouse button to grow  
Hold the right mouse button to shrink
